- [Raider.IO] Database Refresh  
- Fix/patch 11 1 changes (#307)  
    * Added the report advertisement fix part of this update as it still seems to be an issue.  
    * Minor doc updates and improved typing on various variables. Added polyfill classes to the old dropdown menu struct, which we should consider fully deprecating very soon, at least for patch 12.  
    * Prepared TOC bumps to latest versions of the game client.  
    * Removed the older interface versions from the clients as they don't exist anymore.
